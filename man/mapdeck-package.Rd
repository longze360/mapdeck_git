\title{Create Interactive Maps with Multiple Provider Support}
\description{
Create interactive maps using various mapping providers including Mapbox, Leaflet,
OpenLayers, and Chinese mapping services (Gaode, Baidu) with deck.gl visualization layers.
The \code{mapdeck} function creates interactive maps with support for multiple mapping
providers while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing Mapbox-based code.
It provides a unified interface for creating maps with different base map providers
and supports all existing deck.gl visualization layers.
