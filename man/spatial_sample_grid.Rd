\usage{
spatial_sample_grid(
  data,
  grid_size,
  bounds = NULL,
  aggregation_method = "centroid",
  engine = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Spatial data (sf object or data.frame with coordinates)}

\item{grid_size}{Numeric grid cell size in coordinate units}

\item{bounds}{Optional bounding box as c(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)}

\item{aggregation_method}{Method for aggregating points within cells:
"centroid" (default), "random", or "first"}

\item{engine}{Optional SamplingEngine instance (created if NULL)}
}
\value{
Grid-sampled spatial data
}
\description{
Perform regular grid sampling on geospatial data with automatic
GPU acceleration when available.
}
\examples{

# Grid sampling with default centroid aggregation

# Grid sampling with random aggregation

# Grid sampling with bounds
