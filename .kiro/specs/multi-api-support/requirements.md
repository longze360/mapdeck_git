# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature extends the mapdeck R package to support multiple mapping APIs beyond the current Mapbox GL JS implementation. Currently, mapdeck is tightly coupled to Mapbox, requiring users to have Mapbox access tokens and limiting them to Mapbox styles and features. This enhancement will provide a flexible architecture that allows users to choose from multiple mapping providers while maintaining the existing deck.gl visualization capabilities.

The goal is to create a provider-agnostic interface that supports Mapbox GL JS, Leaflet, OpenLayers, Chinese mapping services (AutoNavi/Gaode Maps, Baidu Maps), and potentially other mapping libraries, while preserving backward compatibility with existing mapdeck code. Additionally, this enhancement will introduce spatial sampling functions built on deck.gl technology for advanced geospatial analysis.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an R developer, I want to choose different map providers (Mapbox, Leaflet, OpenLayers, Chinese mapping services) when creating interactive maps, so that I can use the mapping service that best fits my project requirements and constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call `mapdeck()` with a `provider` parameter THEN the system SHALL initialize the specified mapping provider
2. WHEN I specify `provider = "mapbox"` THEN the system SHALL use Mapbox GL JS as the base map (current behavior)
3. WHEN I specify `provider = "leaflet"` THEN the system SHALL use Leaflet as the base map with deck.gl overlay
4. WHEN I specify `provider = "openlayers"` THEN the system SHALL use OpenLayers as the base map with deck.gl overlay
5. WHEN I specify `provider = "gaode"` THEN the system SHALL use AutoNavi/Gaode Maps as the base map with deck.gl overlay
6. WHEN I specify `provider = "baidu"` THEN the system SHALL use Baidu Maps as the base map with deck.gl overlay
7. WHEN I omit the `provider` parameter THEN the system SHALL default to Mapbox for backward compatibility

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an R developer, I want to use provider-specific configuration options and styles, so that I can leverage the unique features and styling capabilities of each mapping provider.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use Mapbox provider THEN the system SHALL support existing Mapbox styles and token authentication
2. WHEN I use Leaflet provider THEN the system SHALL support Leaflet tile layers and provider-specific options
3. WHEN I use OpenLayers provider THEN the system SHALL support OpenLayers sources and layer configurations
4. WHEN I use Gaode provider THEN the system SHALL support Gaode Maps API key authentication and Chinese map styles
5. WHEN I use Baidu provider THEN the system SHALL support Baidu Maps API key authentication and Chinese coordinate systems
6. WHEN I call `mapdeck_style()` THEN the system SHALL return appropriate styles for the current provider
7. WHEN I use an incompatible style with a provider THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message
8. WHEN I use Chinese providers THEN the system SHALL handle coordinate system transformations (WGS84, GCJ02, BD09) automatically

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an R developer, I want all existing deck.gl layers to work consistently across different map providers, so that I can switch providers without changing my visualization code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add any deck.gl layer (scatterplot, polygon, arc, etc.) THEN the layer SHALL render correctly regardless of the base map provider
2. WHEN I use layer interactions (click, hover, tooltip) THEN they SHALL work consistently across all providers
3. WHEN I use layer animations and transitions THEN they SHALL function identically on all supported providers
4. WHEN I update or clear layers THEN the operations SHALL work uniformly across providers

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an R developer, I want to manage authentication tokens for different providers in a unified way, so that I can easily configure access to various mapping services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call `set_token(provider = "mapbox", token = "...")` THEN the system SHALL store the Mapbox token
2. WHEN I call `set_token(provider = "gaode", token = "...")` THEN the system SHALL store the Gaode Maps API key
3. WHEN I call `set_token(provider = "baidu", token = "...")` THEN the system SHALL store the Baidu Maps API key
4. WHEN I call `get_access_token(provider = "mapbox")` THEN the system SHALL return the stored Mapbox token
5. WHEN I call `mapdeck_tokens()` THEN the system SHALL display all configured provider tokens
6. WHEN a provider requires authentication and no token is set THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an R developer, I want my existing mapdeck code to continue working without modifications, so that I can upgrade to the multi-provider version without breaking changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use existing `mapdeck()` calls without provider specification THEN they SHALL work exactly as before
2. WHEN I use existing `set_token()` calls THEN they SHALL continue to set Mapbox tokens
3. WHEN I use existing `mapdeck_style()` calls THEN they SHALL return Mapbox styles
4. WHEN I use any existing layer functions THEN they SHALL work identically to the current implementation
5. WHEN I run existing test suites THEN they SHALL pass without modification

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an R developer, I want to easily switch between providers for the same visualization, so that I can compare different mapping solutions or adapt to changing requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a map with one provider THEN I SHALL be able to recreate it with a different provider using the same data and layer configurations
2. WHEN I call `update_provider(map, new_provider)` THEN the system SHALL switch the base map while preserving all layers
3. WHEN switching providers THEN all layer data, styling, and interactions SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN a provider-specific feature is not available THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade or provide alternatives

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an R developer, I want to perform spatial sampling operations using deck.gl technology, so that I can conduct advanced geospatial analysis and statistical sampling on large datasets efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call `spatial_sample_random(data, n)` THEN the system SHALL return n randomly sampled points from the spatial dataset
2. WHEN I call `spatial_sample_grid(data, cell_size)` THEN the system SHALL create a regular grid sampling of the spatial area
3. WHEN I call `spatial_sample_stratified(data, strata_column, n_per_stratum)` THEN the system SHALL perform stratified sampling based on specified attributes
4. WHEN I call `spatial_sample_cluster(data, n_clusters, points_per_cluster)` THEN the system SHALL perform cluster-based spatial sampling
5. WHEN I call `spatial_sample_administrative(admin_polygons, total_samples, allocation_method)` THEN the system SHALL generate random coordinate points within administrative boundaries proportionally
6. WHEN I specify `allocation_method = "proportional"` THEN sample sizes SHALL be allocated based on area or population of each administrative unit
7. WHEN I specify `allocation_method = "equal"` THEN sample sizes SHALL be distributed equally across administrative units
8. WHEN I use spatial sampling functions THEN they SHALL prioritize GPU acceleration using deck.gl's WebGL capabilities
9. WHEN GPU is not available THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to CPU-based processing
10. WHEN I enable `concurrent = TRUE` THEN the system SHALL process multiple administrative units simultaneously
11. WHEN sampling large datasets THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators and handle memory efficiently
12. WHEN I visualize sampling results THEN they SHALL integrate seamlessly with existing mapdeck layer functions
13. WHEN I generate samples within administrative boundaries THEN the system SHALL ensure all points fall strictly within the polygon boundaries

### Requirement 8
